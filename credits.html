                    <h3>Eric Grimm</h3>
                    <p>I was responsible for getting the initial version of the bubble chart up and running with Kyle. After accomplishing this task, I switched gears and began working on sorting the data in order to make different visualizations. I used JSON objects to sort the data since it interfaces well with D3. I sorted the master Florida Man JSON file, by verbs, gender, restaurants, animals, and year. After sorting the files, I made the script files that were responsible for running the D3 visualizations. Lastly, I cleaned up the file directory for the project.</p>

                    <h3>Kyle Major</h3>
                    <p>Initially, I was responsible for helping Eric to clean and sort the data, and generate the bubble charts to represent it. From there I switched focus to identifying patterns in the data that would make for good visualizations. After that I worked with Nikola to generate the bar charts, and helped to troubleshoot issues related to HTML/CSS, drawing on my experience from a summer internship. Additionally, I conducted a thorough investigation into whether or not it was feasible to create a backend component that could serve the project effectively in a browser, finding that for the sake of time, it is probably best to serve the project on Mimir. Lastly, I helped create the HTML/Script files for various parts of the webpage.</p>

                    <p>I was responsible for generating the bar charts and scatter plot. Additionally, I assisted Jaysa with the front-end development of the website. I helped my team troubleshoot technical issues with the tools we were using, like downloading extensions in Visual Studio and making sure that everything was working.</p>

                    <p>I was responsible for project management and the creation of all our documentation, including the sprint reports. I located the dataset and helped to gather resources (tutorials, files, etc.) so we could work with it. I was also responsible for the front-end design and development of our project, like the front page of our website, the credits page, and the integration of all the visualizations into our site with a navbar that allows users to choose which visualization they’d like to see. I used the Bootstrap framework to organize content on each web page and generate an interactive navigation bar with dropdowns for certain categories of our site. Lastly, I helped to finalize the documentation for the project report, including a diagram of the architecture of our project.</p>
